# Add-Ons for Citavi 6
Citavi Add-Ons do not have installers (if not distributed through Citavi). Here's how to install them:

1. Make sure you are using the latest version of Citavi (Help > Check for updates).
2. Exit Citavi.
3. In Windows Explorer, open the Citavi program folder (by default C:\Program Files (x86)\Citavi 6).
4. Inside it, create a folder named AddOns.
5. Download the Citavi Add-On you want to install.
6. Copy it to the AddOns folder.

When installing more than one Citavi Add-On, Windows Explorer may ask whether you want to merge the contents of the folder en. Click Yes.
Under Windows 10, 8, or 7, if User Account Control is enabled, you may need to allow the change.
